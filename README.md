# pyrentals

This module is currently made up by a single file containing a single class called Cart used to contain a list of Rental items represented as a dictionary with the "Type" and "Time" keys. It allows to calculate the resulting price for the rental collection and apply a discount when a deal qualifies for one.

The repository also contains a file for testing the class along with this introductory ReadMe and it has been developed while learning about Python projects and virtual environments along with tools and IDEs such as pip, venv, PyCharm and Visual Studio, along with the unittest.TestClass usage for creating and running unit tests.
